Calibrating the sensitivities of the various Wildlife Acoustics microphones, programs and SongMeter models for Dr. Jesse Barber's Sensory Ecology Lab at Boise State University.

Project starting Spring 2024

Aims:

1) Generate playback stimuli
2) Analyze recordings of all setups to determine the variation in relative sensitivities
3) Integrate this variation when modeling detectability of different experimental sites
