## Generating white noise for use in ultrasonic microphone calibration

Goal: Generate broad-spectrum white noise for playback test of WildLife Acoustics microphone and Song Meter acoustic recording units sensitivities.

```{r packages}
library(tuneR)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
